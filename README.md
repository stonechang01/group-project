Step 1: Read file and seperate into different strings.
Step 2: Find the start by taking the first five letters and going through all the other sections. If no other sections have those letters, that section is the start.
Step 3: After finding the start, take the last five letters of that section and comparing them to all other sections. If a section has those five letters near or at the beginning, take all the letters after them and add them to the start section. I1.	f the last five letters in a section arenâ€™t found in any other sections, find the last four letters instead.
